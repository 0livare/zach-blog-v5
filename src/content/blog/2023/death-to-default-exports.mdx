import {Aside, mdxComponents} from '~/components'
export const components = mdxComponents

I am continuously surprised at how commonly I see developers using default exports as their "default" strategy for exporting JavaScript modules from files. I will make the case in this post that you should prefer named exports for every module exported from every one of your JS files.

If you get to the end of this article and still have something to say in defense of default exports, please [let me know](http://www.twitter.com/0livare)!

## 1. The sole advantage is in fact a disadvantage

The only advantage of default exports is that you can import them with a different name than they had when they were exported. But why would you ever intentionally do that? To make it harder to do a global project search for the name of the component? To make your code less readable? To hasten the heat death of the universe?

You would never do intentionally do that, but with default exports doing so _accidentally_ is only one typo away.

## 2. You can't export default const (or let, or var)

You can't default export a variable at the same time you declare it, so instead it becomes a more awkward two step process. This is especially annoying if you're the type of person who likes to declare your functions with `const`:

```js
const myFunction = () => {
  // A
  // whole
  // bunch
  // of
  // code
  // that
  // you
  // have
  // to
  // scroll
  // past
}

export default myFunction
```

When reading this file you now have to scroll down to the bottom of the function to know if it's exported or not, AND IF SO BY WHAT NAME.

It's so much nicer with a named export

```js
export const myFunction = () => {}
```

Chalk this up as one more reason to just declare your function as a `function`? Ugh that's a fight for another <strike>day</strike> post.

## 3. Default exports can't be re-exported from barrel files

I love barrel files, because I love clean imports. Being able to do:

```js
import {Thing1, Thing2, Thing3} from '~/components'
```

and not have to worry exactly which file each of those components lives and not have a long complicated import path for every module in is a huge win for developer experience in my book.

But if you `export default Thing1`, then in the barrel file the star export `export * from './thing1'` isn't going to work because Thing1 doesn't have a module name! So instead you're forced to give it one, similarly to how you would if you were trying to import the module:

```js
export {default as Thing1} from './thing1'
export * from './thing1' // Still necessary if there are other named exports
```

Just another opportunity for a typo.

## 4. Mixing default imports with named imports creates inconsistency

Because each file can only have a single default export, you're always going to have some named exports even if you're intentionally trying to avoid them.

> Using TypeScript? **Every** exported `type` is a named export.

And now all of a sudden you've got both kinds scattered about your codebase and you can't be certain how to import the module you need without opening the file and checking.

  I have a similar argument for why your filenames should all use kebab-case, but that's a fight for
  another <strike>day</strike> post.
</Aside>

## 5. Mixing default imports with named imports is awkward

Not to mention that it's just so awkward to import both a default and named export from the same module:

```ts
import MyComponent, {type MyComponentProps} from './my-component'
```

## 6. It's just less typing

If I still haven't convinced you to drop the `default`, can I persuade you with silly character count argument?

```js
// Default Export: 91 characters
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
export default colors
import colors from './colors'
```

```js
// Named Export: 78 characters
export const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
import {colors} from './colors'
```

**But my favorite framework uses default exports for all kinds of stuff!**

Frameworks like Next.js and Remix use default exports because otherwise they would need to know the name of your component for them to import it!

Take this excerpt from the example on the [Remix home page](https://remix.run):

```js
export async function loader({request}) {
  return getProjects()
}

export async function action({request}) {
  const form = await request.formData()
  return createProject({title: form.get('title')})
}

export default function Projects() {
  /* ... */
}
```

`loader` and `action` here are named exports, and that's one of the reasons that those functions **must** have exactly those names! Name them anything else and they won't work (also JS only allows a single default export per file).

Remix uses the `default` export for the component so that it doesn't have to care what the component's name is, which allows you the user to name it whatever makes sense for your application.

But in your application code, you don't have the same problem. You already know the name of your own component!
