The site you're reading this on is now built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Why

The primary reason I made this change was to improve my blog post writing experience.

My previous Next.js implementation of this blog has a "custom" MDX parsing implementation. While that was super flexible and allowed me to do some interesting things in the MDX -> React conversion process, the process of actually authoring a new blog post was terrible.

It sucked primarily because it lacked any kind of hot-reloading. So every time I wanted to see a change reflected in the browser, I had to refresh the page and scroll back down to my area of interest. ohmahgosh it was so frickin' annoying.

Astro totes itself as a "content focused" framework, and I have heard good things about it's ability to parse MDX, so I thought it might be able to help me improve my authoring issues.
