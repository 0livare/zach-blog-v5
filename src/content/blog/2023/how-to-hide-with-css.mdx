import {Aside, BlockQuote, ShowMore, mdxComponents} from '~/components'
export const components = mdxComponents

- display:none turns off the layout of the elements, so they are not rendered
- visibility:hidden hides the elements without changing their layouts
- opacity:0 causes the elements to be very transparent but users can still interact with them.
- HTML hidden attribute
- SR Only

display:none removes the element from the normal flow of the page, allowing other elements to fill in.

visibility:hidden leaves the element in the normal flow of the page such that is still occupies space.
