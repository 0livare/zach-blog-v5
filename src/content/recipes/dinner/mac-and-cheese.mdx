Elbow macaroni is the classic pasta for mac and cheese, but any kind of pasta works. Those varieties having a rough surface hold the sauce better. Although cheese lovers might be tempted to boost the sauce-to-pasta ratio, keep in mind that the sauce is very rich. A little goes a long way.

<Aside variant="gray">
  Don't be scared away by the Sodium Citrate! It acts as a binding agent between the cheese and the
  noodles, and replaces the flour typically used for such a job that blands the flavor of the
  cheese.
