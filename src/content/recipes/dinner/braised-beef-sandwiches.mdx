## Cook the Roast

1. **Liberally** season the roast on all sides with salt
1. _Optional_: If you have the time, let the roast sit in the fridge covered in salt for up to two hours
1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees
1. Heat a deep pan or dutch oven on the stove-top over medium high heat
1. Season the roast with pepper on all sides
1. Once the pan is hot, add add some oil and sear the roast on all sides
1. Remove the roast from the pan
1. Add a bit of the beef stock to the pan and scrape up the fond (the little browned bits)
1. Add the ranch seasoning and stir until dissolved
1. Add the Pepperoncini Peppers, and pour in about the same amount of juice from the jar
1. Add the roast back to the pan
1. Add enough beef stock to come about three quarters of the way up the roast
1. Cover the pan and place in the oven for 5-7 hours, or until the roast falls apart when you press down it with the back of a spoon

## Make the Sandwiches

1. Shred the beef
1. Toast the buns (I like to use a little butter and toast them in a pan)
1. Spread chipotle mayo on the bottom of the buns
1. Heat up some BBQ sauce in the microwave, and then toss the shredded beef in the sauce to coat
1. Pile the beef on the buns
1. Add a bit more chipotle mayo on top of the beef
1. Devour

## Freeze the rest

One of the best parts of braising beef is that it freezes really well. And then you can heat it up for quick and delicious lunch. You could even choose to freeze all of it for meal prepping.

1. Add the beef to a gallon bag with a few spoonfuls of the braising liquid
1. Flatten it out and remove as much air as possible
1. With your finger or the back of a utensil, score lines on the bag to divide it into 4 sections
1. Freeze it flat
   - If you think of it, when the bag has started to freeze but is not frozen through, you can fold the bag back along the score lines to make it take up less freezer space.

## Warm it up

1. When you need a quick but amazing lunch, fold the bag to break off one or more of the sections
1. Place it in a skillet over medium heat
1. Once one side has begun to thaw, flip it over and break it up with a spatula
1. Just like with the original, toss it in BBQ, toast the buns, add the chipotle mayo, and boom you're done!
