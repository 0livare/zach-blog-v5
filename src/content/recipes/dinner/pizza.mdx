## Dough

This is a classic Neapolitan pizza dough. It's best when rolled thin and cooked quickly at a very high temperature.

Antico Caputo 00 is an extremely fine wheat flour used by most pizzerias in Naples to create an elastic dough; buy it online or ad specialty food markets. You can substitute all-purpose flour, but you may need to add up to 10% more water.
