I find that too often Chex Mix includes a lot of things that no one really cares for. Instead, I skip all that and get right to the good stuff.

<Aside variant="gray">
  The ingredients list above uses a lot of butter. While I maintain that this ratio is the most
  delicious version, if you would like it to be slightly healthier, you can halve all of the
  ingredients except for the cereal and pretzels and it will still turn out tasty.
