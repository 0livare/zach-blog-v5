[Original Recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/chex-mix-recipe-23022715)

I find that too often Chex Mix includes a lot of things that no one really cares for. Instead, I skip all that and get right to the good stuff.

<Aside variant="gray">
  The ingredients list above uses a lot of butter. While I maintain that this ratio is the most
  delisious version, if you would like it to be slightly healthier, you can halve all of the
  ingredients except for the cereal and pretzels and it will still turn out tasty.

<Instructions>
  <Step>
    <b>Heat the oven to 250°F.</b> Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven
    to 250°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <b>Make the seasoning mixture.</b> Place the butter in a medium, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave
    in 10-second intervals, stirring between each, until fully melted, 50 to 60 seconds total.
    (Alternatively, melt in a small saucepan on the stovetop over low heat.) Add the remaining wet
    ingredients and spaces, whisk well to combine.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <b>Combine the Chex cereal</b> and pretzels, tossing lightly.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <b>Toss with butter.</b> Pour half the butter mixture over the cereal mixture and toss gently
    with your hands to coat. Pour the remaining butter mixture toss again.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <b>Bake until lightly brown and crispy</b>. Transfer the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets
    and spread into an even layer. Bake, stirring every 30 minutes, until lightly browned and crisp,
    50 to 60 minutes total.
  </Step>
