[Original recipe](https://cookiesandcups.com/perfect-rice-krispie-treat-recipe/)

A classic recipe, but improved. Two tips before you begin:

- Don't think of these as cereal with a little marshmellow, think of them as marshmellow with a little bit of cereal
- Don't skip the salt! It's a small amount but it cuts the sweetness in just the right way.
