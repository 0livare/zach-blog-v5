[Original recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/brown-butter-and-toffee-chocolate-chip-cookies)

Using chocolate wafers instead of chips is a cookie game-changer. They spread as they melt, creating thin pockets of chocolate in each layer, and stay much softer at room temperature. Makes about 20 cookies.
