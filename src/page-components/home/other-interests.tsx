      <Paragraph>
        When I&apos;m not writing code, I enjoy cooking, photography, and spending time with my
        fianc√© Kierstyn and my two dogs, Lola and Fitz. I&apos;m an avid Brewers fan and love
        venturing into the great outdoors whenever possible.

        Also, as you might have guessed from my website, I also enjoy solving Rubik&apos;s cubes! I
        have cubes as small as a 2x2 and as large as a 7x7, but my favorite is still the good
        &apos;ol 3x3.
